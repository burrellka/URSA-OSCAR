"""Package entry point — invoked via `python -m ursa_oscar_mcp`.

Importing `mcp` from `.server` ensures the server module loads exactly once
(under the canonical `ursa_oscar_mcp.server` name), so tool modules that do
`from ..server import mcp` register against the same FastMCP instance the
running uvicorn loop is serving.

If we ran `python -m ursa_oscar_mcp.server` instead, Python would create a
second instance of the server module (one as __main__, one as the package
module), and tools would register against the package-module copy while
uvicorn served the __main__ copy — claude.ai's tools/list would return [].
